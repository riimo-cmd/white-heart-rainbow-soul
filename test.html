    <p>> its going to Shalomyan Bowers he is the leader of the black lifes matter organization in Atlanta.<br>

>also the Blm protesters that cause violence,burning down business and hurt police officers are really not helping the cause neither. <br>

Most of the BLM protests in the United States are peaceful,<a href="https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/publications/black-lives-matter-protesters-were-overwhelmingly-peaceful-our-research-finds">3</a> <a href="https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/">4</a> however violence gets clicks and views.<br> 

> all lives matter and it doesn't matter what your skin color is.<br>

All lives will not matter until black lives matter. Even then, we still have a long way to go. </p>
